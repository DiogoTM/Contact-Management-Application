3. Search for a contact by:
 contact number

5. Exit application

Requirements:
1. Create the necessary structures.
2. Create a dynamic array to store all the contacts 
3. The tasks listed in the menu have to be built as independent functions. 
4. Create the header file and implementations file 
5. Add small comment before each function implementation. 
6. You have to overload the necessary functions 
7. You have to overload the input stream and output stream operators 
8. The main application has to call these functions.(create a friendly application) 
9. Use templates functions instead of overloaded functions (when necessary) 
10. Use the C++ name convention 
11. Add comments specifying: the author of the application, submitted to your teacher, the created
date, the small description of the application, the version number of the application.
